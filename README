HDE
===
hde is a new window manager for the X11 system which was based
on qlwm, it should support all international languages including
arabic.
Because it makes heavy use of Qt it can be kept small andeasy to 
maintain.
hde2 has many futures, one of them it can emulate the look and 
feel of windows vista, without the need of buying a new computer
to have the minimum configuration of windows vista.


It has been written with GPL license and should stay open source. 

CREDITS
=======
Special thanks to Alexander Linden for his qlwm.


Development
===========
Feel free to create some configuration files and other programs
based on hde, the libhde give you an easy way to render and text
or change it's language for your applications including arabic 
rendering.
